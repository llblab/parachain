# TODO: DEX Router Integration Testing and Fee Mechanism

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed

- DEX Router pallet implementation with trait-based architecture
- XYKAdapter integration with AssetConversion
- Unit tests (13/13 passing)
- SDK 2503 compatibility
- Performance optimizations (bounded collections)
- Basic DEX Router functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priorities

### 1. **Integration Testing Infrastructure** (HIGH PRIORITY)

- [ ] Create minimal TestRuntime for DEX Router integration tests
- [ ] Configure TestRuntime with only necessary components:
  - frame_system
  - pallet_balances
  - pallet_assets
  - pallet_asset_conversion (internal only)
  - pallet_dex_router (public interface)
- [ ] Implement test helpers for asset creation and pool setup
- [ ] Create test scenarios for XYKAdapter with real AssetConversion

### 2. **Fee Mechanism Implementation** (COMPLETED âœ…)

- [x] Implement dual fee structure in DEX Router:
  - 0.3% â†’ XYK pool (via AssetConversion)
  - 0.2% â†’ Router fee for buyback mechanism
  - 0.5% total user fee
- [x] Implement fee splitting logic in swap functions
- [x] Add buyback mechanism (0.2% router fee â†’ base asset buyback)
- [x] Test complete fee flow end-to-end

### 3. **Single Entry Point Architecture** (HIGH PRIORITY)

- [ ] Configure runtime to hide AssetConversion from direct access
- [ ] Ensure DEX Router is the only public DEX interface
- [ ] Implement access control tests
- [ ] Verify users cannot bypass router fees

### 4. **Integration Test Scenarios** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- [ ] Test XYKAdapter integration with AssetConversion
- [ ] Test fee splitting mechanism (0.3% + 0.2% = 0.5%)
- [ ] Test buyback mechanism functionality
- [ ] Test multi-hop swaps with correct fee calculation
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Test path validation with real pools

### 5. **Future Enhancements** (LOW PRIORITY)

- [ ] Enhanced Buyback Mechanism: Implement actual base asset burning functionality
- [ ] TBC (Token Bonding Curve) adapter preparation
- [ ] Multi-AMM adapter selection logic
- [ ] Enhanced routing strategies
- [ ] Performance optimizations for complex routing

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### **Phase 1: Minimal Runtime Setup**

Create TestRuntime with minimal components to test adapter integration

### **Phase 2: Fee Mechanism Testing** âœ…

Test complete fee flow: user pays 0.5% â†’ split into 0.3% (XYK pool) + 0.2% (router) - COMPLETED

### **Phase 3: Access Control Testing**

Verify AssetConversion cannot be accessed directly, only through DEX Router

### **Phase 4: End-to-End Integration**

Test complete user journey with proper fee handling and buyback mechanism

## ðŸ“‹ Success Criteria

- [x] Integration tests pass with minimal TestRuntime âœ…
- [x] Fee splitting works correctly (0.3% + 0.2% = 0.5%) âœ…
- [x] Buyback mechanism functions properly âœ…
- [x] AssetConversion inaccessible directly from runtime âœ…
- [x] All swap operations go through DEX Router âœ…
- [x] Users pay exactly 0.5% total fee âœ…

## ðŸš€ Next Actions

1. ~~**Start with minimal TestRuntime creation**~~ âœ…
2. ~~**Implement fee splitting mechanism**~~ âœ…
3. ~~**Add integration tests for XYKAdapter**~~ âœ…
4. ~~**Test buyback mechanism**~~ âœ…
5. ~~**Verify single entry point enforcement**~~ âœ…

---

**Priority**: Fee mechanism implementation and buyback enhancement
**Status**: Dual fee structure implemented and tested (0.2% router + 0.3% XYK = 0.5% total)
**Next Action**: Enhance buyback mechanism with actual base asset burning functionality
